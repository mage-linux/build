Mage Build
==========
Mage GNU/Linux's image builder. The goal of that toolset is to build a minimal
image capable of building itself. It will later be used to build full versions
of mage. All packages are statically built against musl-libc to be able to
easily move binaries and avoid the problems of dynamic linking.
The main script mk.sh has 3 options, -n which initialize a new image, -i which
installs a new package and -b which builds the final image.
To build an image, you will need a compiler targetting musl, which you can
obtain with mussel or musl-cross-make if you are not on a distribution shipped
with musl.
The typical build looks like this:
---
./mk.sh -n                                            # Create the image
./mk.sh -i kernel busybox init musl make binutils gcc # Install packages
./mk.sh -b                                            # Finish the image
---
You can now use qemu on the image at output/image.
